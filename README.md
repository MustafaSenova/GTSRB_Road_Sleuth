      Real-Time Traffic Sign Recognition



This project aims to develop a real-time traffic sign recognition system using convolutional neural networks (CNNs). The system can accurately identify and classify traffic signs in real-time video streams captured by onboard cameras or external sensors.

Features
Real-time traffic sign recognition using CNNs.
Efficient and accurate classification of traffic signs under varying environmental conditions.
User-friendly interface with clear visual feedback.
Optimized for deployment on resource-constrained devices.

Requirements:

-Python 3.x
-TensorFlow
-Keras
-OpenCV
-NumPy
